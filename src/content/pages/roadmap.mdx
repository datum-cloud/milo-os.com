# Roadmap

## Today, a growing foundation

While we're most excited about GTM and commercial aspects of our roadmap, the first step for any cloud provider is to build a strong 'system of record' foundation around customers, products, quotas, etc. Here’s what we’re working on today:

### System of Record
- **Operator Portal** – Single pane of glass for business operations with real-time dashboards
- **Contacts Management** – Marketing automation with dynamic segmentation and GDPR-compliant opt-in flows
- **Customer Hierarchy** – Multi-tier account management supporting everything from individual users to enterprise parent accounts
- **Unified Audit Log** – Cross-platform event tracking for compliance and operational intelligence

### Product Experience
- **Programmable Product Catalog** – API-first foundation that powers billing, quoting, and feature access control
- **Transparent Pricing Engine** – Multi-model pricing support (usage-based, subscription, hybrid) with automatic scaling
- **Entitlements System** – Granular feature access, quota management, and service tier enforcement

### Technology Approach
- Cloud-native microservices architecture
- Kubernetes Resource Model for service provider tooling
- Multi-tenant by design with enterprise-grade security
- Horizontal scaling across regions and availability zones
