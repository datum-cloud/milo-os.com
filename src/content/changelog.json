[{"id":"D_kwDONK56Bc4Ai7E4","title":"Controlled Onboarding and Waitlists","body":"To support the launch of Datum Cloud, we needed a waitlist feature to control early access and then initiate onboarding for select users. We designed a simple feature to help us out. Here’s how it works:\r\n\r\n- End users can sign up for a waitlist tied to the authentication method of their choosing (GitHub or Google). This streamlines the onboarding experience once approved. \r\n- Platform admins can grant permission to specific users, triggering an email notice.  \r\n- Alternatively, admins can send personalized invitations to contacts who have not yet requested access via the waitlist. This allows friends and family to skip the line. \r\n\r\nCheck out the work history on GitHub [Issue #372](https://github.com/datum-cloud/enhancements/issues/372)","url":"https://github.com/orgs/datum-cloud/discussions/127","createdAt":"2025-11-18T23:35:32Z","labels":{"nodes":[]}},{"id":"D_kwDONK56Bc4Ai695","title":"Contact & list management","body":"Milo now supports the ability to create & manage contacts in groups fit for specific needs like marketing campaigns or operational notifications. \r\n\r\nKey features: \r\n\r\n- Create contact resources with basic fields (name, email address, status) \r\n- Create and manage public or private lists with the ability to add or remove contacts\r\n- Store preferences and consent per contact with traceable timestamps \r\n\r\nCheck out the work history on Github [Issue #193](https://github.com/datum-cloud/enhancements/issues/193)","url":"https://github.com/orgs/datum-cloud/discussions/123","createdAt":"2025-11-18T20:36:10Z","labels":{"nodes":[]}}]
