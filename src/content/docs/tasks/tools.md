The Datum control plane is a collection of multiple projects developed with
Kubernetes control plane technology, most of which can be installed into native
Kubernetes clusters.

As a result, you will leverage common Kubernetes tooling such as [kubectl][kubectl]
to interact with Datum.

## Install Tools

### datumctl

<div class="tabs">
  <div class="tab-header">
    <div class="tab active">macOS</div>
  </div>
  <div class="tab-content">
    <div class="tab-pane active">
      Install datumctl with the [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) package manager:

      ```shell
      brew install datum-cloud/tap/datumctl
      ```
    </div>

  </div>
</div>

### kubectl

Refer to the [official Kubernetes documentation][kubectl-task] for installation
instructions, making sure to **skip the Verify kubectl configuration** section in
the guide you choose.

Later in this guide, you will configure a [kubeconfig file](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/organize-cluster-access-kubeconfig/)
as required to interact with Datum via kubectl.

[kubectl-task]: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl

## Create API Credentials

1. Sign in to Datum at <https://cloud.datum.net>
2. Create an API token by navigating to
   **User Settings > API Tokens > Create a new token**. Save this token in your
   password manager or preferred method of storage.

## Configure Tools

### Authentication

Configure datumctl authentication by activating the API token created in the
previous section. Run the following command and enter your API token at the
prompt:

```shell
datumctl auth activate-api-token
```

### Add a kubeconfig context for your organization

Obtain your organization's resource ID with datumctl by listing organizations
that your user has access to:

```shell
datumctl organizations list
```

The output is similar to:

```shell
DISPLAY NAME           RESOURCE ID
Personal Organization  pp4zn7tiw5be3beygm2d6mbcfe
```

Create a kubeconfig context to access your organization's resources by copying
the the `RESOURCE ID` value and executing following command, replacing
`RESOURCE_ID` with the value:

```shell
datumctl auth update-kubeconfig --organization RESOURCE_ID
```

The output is similar to:

```shell
Successfully updated kubeconfig at getting-started.kubeconfig
```

### Verify kubectl configuration

Check that kubectl is properly configured by getting authorized user info:

```shell
kubectl auth whoami
```

The output is similar to:

```shell
ATTRIBUTE                                                VALUE
Username                                                 datum@example.com
Groups                                                   [system:authenticated]
Extra: authentication.datum.net/datum-organization-uid   [pp4zn7tiw5be3beygm2d6mbcfe]
Extra: authentication.kubernetes.io/credential-id        [JTI=01jgsr1m8fpb9cn0yrh05taa5v]
```
