description: Datum is a network cloud you can take anywhere, backed by open source.
order: 1
---

Our cloud platform, global network, and open source tooling are designed to help developers and modern service providers run network workloads anywhere while connecting their applications programmatically to the hundreds — or thousands — of partners, providers and customers that make up their unique ecosystem.

## Current status

Datum is in active development across three areas:

- **Datum Cloud** - A hosted control plane for users to view their federated (bring your own cloud) locations, authorization/access, and tap into end-to-end observability.
- **Datum Network** - A high capacity global network designed to be your superhighway between clouds, network providers, SaaS providers, and Enterprise customers.
- **Open Source** - Kubernetes native tooling to help developers deploy and lifecycle network workloads on any infrastructure. Leverages an AGPL v3 license.

## What to expect this year

This year we’re standing up our platform and network while working to build trust with relevant communities. In terms of capabilities, here is what we're prioritizing:

- Ability to leverage Datum Cloud for data plane / workloads in addition to bring your own cloud (BYOC) zones.
- Multiple ways to bring traffic into Datum Cloud, including authoritative DNS, built in global proxy / LB, DDoS filtering, GRE or IPSec tunnels and more
- Manage traffic with service chaining to offload and route securely in private, controlled paths (to clouds, SaaS services or other destinations)
- Developing a partner friendly model that supports both commercial and open source NFV solutions
- Supporting marketplace transactions to remove margin-stacking on 3rd party technologies
- Reimagining the interface and data model for private application and ecosystem interconnections
