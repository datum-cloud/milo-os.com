IPs are not allowed.<br />Hostnames must be verified before being programmed. This is accomplished<br />via the use of `Domain` resources. A hostname is considered verified if any<br />verified `Domain` resource exists in the same namespace where the<br />`spec.domainName` of the resource either exactly matches the hostname, or<br />is a suffix match of the hostname. That means that a Domain with a<br />`spec.domainName` of `example.com` will match a hostname of<br />`test.example.com`, `foo.test.example.com`, and exactly `example.com`, but<br />not a hostname of `test-example.com`. If a `Domain` resource does not exist<br />that matches a hostname, one will automatically be created when the system<br />attempts to program the HTTPProxy.<br />In addition to verifying ownership, hostnames must be unique across the<br />platform. If a hostname is already programmed on another resource, a<br />conflict will be encountered and communicated in the `HostnamesVerified`<br />condition.<br />Hostnames which have been programmed will be listed in the<br />`status.hostnames` field. Any hostname which has not been programmed will<br />be listed in the `message` field of the `HostnamesVerified` condition with<br />an indication as to why it was not programmed.<br />The system may automatically generate and associate hostnames with the<br />HTTPProxy. In such cases, these will be listed in the `status.hostnames`<br />field and do not require additional configuration by the user.<br />Wildcard hostnames are not supported at this time. |  | MaxItems: 16 <br />Optional: \{\} <br /> |
